# DS_TEAM_I_COMP439_Project1
 
 The purpose of this project is to simulate IOT.  IOT is utilized in many
 everyday appliances and devices.  These devices are always available
 through the network.  This project will support smart devices, such as lightbulbs
 and smart outlets / powerstrips, and other smart devices.
 
 The goal of the project is to implement software that will allow us to
 add and remove devices.  It will also allow us to view their current state,
 and creating smart instances, or implementing a timer for automatic power on 
 and power off.  
 
 What is IOT:
 IOT is a technology that enables devices to connect via the internet.  As it is called
 the Internet Of Things.  This will include pretty much any device that can be on the net.
 The purpose of this technology is to make the device "aware".  It also gives the user unparalleled 
 power and utility , all from any remote location.  Device updates, monitoring and other things that are soon to come.
 Devices can range from cameras, to dvd players, or lightbulbs and other devices that are not normally wired for internet use.
 Another great aspect is that the data that will be collected could be extremely valuable to people.  It could give us better
 understandings how the internet works and what we can do with it.

Detailed Information

Test
    void setPowerSwitch() {
    (this is used to either enable the switch to on or off)
    
   @Test
    void isDeviceOn() {
    (this tests to see if the device is either on or off)
    
   @Test
   void getTimer() {
   (this is to get the current running time of the device)
   
   
   @Test
   void checkTimer() {
   (this checks to make sure that time is running)
   
   @Test
    void setDeviceName() {
    (this allows you to set a name for the device)
    
   @Test
   void showState()
   (this shows the state of the device)
   @Test
    void getDeviceName() {
    (this will give you the name of the device that is running)
